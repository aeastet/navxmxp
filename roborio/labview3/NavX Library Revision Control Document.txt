##########Known Bug List and Updates Needed

•	When I click the zero yaw button when using USB it does not completely zero. I'm not sure if we need to do something different in the hardware to make this better.

######### Wish List

•	Integrate SF2.
•	Add gyro drift compensation.
•	Make the library easily installable in the FIRST WPI Menu.
•	We need to add a NavX Micro vi that only allows the operator to us USB 1, USB 2 or I2C On-Board options.

########## COMPLETE
2016 October 27
	Current Version is NavX Library 3.00 - This is the first launch of the software version tracking system with Tim Easterling as developer.

•	Added the action engine model to make the software easier to use. This is why this version of the library is called NavX AE.
•	Added polymorphic vi to place on main diagram. This allows the operator to choose what format they want to use to run the NavX hardware.
•	Added the ability to run two devices easily just by updating the device number.
•	Added USB support.
•	Rebuilt the examples to run with the new system.
•	Reformatted the library to allow for easy integration into the FIRST WPI menu so the VI will show up in the tool palette on LabVIEW.
•	Removed older versions of the NavX library to make code support easier.
•	Built a test window feature so the developrs can see what is going on with the hardware.
•	The serial and USB were not initilizing correctly on start up. I changed the way the system initializes.
